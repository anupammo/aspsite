            <p class="text-justify txt-p"><span class="lead text-uppercase">GIS Service – </span>A geographic information system (GIS), geographical information system, or
            geospatial information system is any system that captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and presents data that
            are linked to location. In the simplest terms, GIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis,
            and database technology. GIS systems are used in cartography, remote sensing, satellite image
            processing, arial photograph, land surveying, utility management, natural resource management,
            photogrammetric, geography features and their location ( latitude, longitude ), urban planning,
            emergency management, navigation and localized search engines.</p>
            <p class="text-justify txt-p">As GIS is a system, it establishes boundaries that may be jurisdictional, purpose or application
            oriented for which a specific GIS is developed. Hence, a GIS developed for an application,
            jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be necessarily interoperable or compatible with a GIS
            that has been developed for some other application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose. What goes
            beyond a GIS is a spatial data infrastructure (SDI), a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries.</p>
            <p class="text-justify txt-p">Therefore, in a general sense, the term describes any information system that integrates stores,
            edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information. In a more generic sense, GIS
            applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze
            spatial information, edit data, maps, and present the results of all these operations. Geographic
            information science is the science underlying the geographic concepts, applications and systems,
            studied in degree and certificate programs at many universities. Normally we used GPS, TS, DGPS
            etc. This job is helping to the nation for their social development.</p>
